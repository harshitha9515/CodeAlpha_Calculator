🧮 NeonCalc – Advanced Scientific Calculator Web App

NeonCalc is a modern, interactive scientific calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It combines core calculator functionality with advanced scientific operations, calculation history, local storage persistence, and a visually rich neon UI.

This project demonstrates strong JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, UI/UX design, and real-world frontend logic implementation.

🚀 Highlights

✅ Basic & scientific calculator operations

✅ Real-time expression evaluation

✅ Scientific mode toggle (sin, cos, log, √, etc.)

✅ Persistent calculation history using LocalStorage

✅ Interactive neon-glass UI design

✅ Error handling & edge-case validation

🧠 Why NeonCalc?

NeonCalc focuses on how real frontend utilities are built, not just basic button logic.

✔ Clean separation of UI & logic

✔ Real-time computation & expression parsing

✔ State persistence using browser storage

✔ Elegant UI with animations & gradients

✔ Modular, readable JavaScript code

This project reflects production-ready frontend problem solving.
